# Welcome to my first README

## I am an h2 header basically

### This is the equivalent of an h3 header
<br>
If I just write plain text, it shows up as a paragraph

Use br <br> to make line breaks

Asteriks are used to *ITALISIZE* and 2 of them make something **BOLD**... and 3 asteriks do ***BOTH***

Indenting text one tab and skipping a line registers it as code

    I am code

## Lists
You can make lists by writing dashes or numbers
1. Apples
2. Bananas
3. Pears

or

- Apples
- Bananas
- Cherries

## Add some images and links

We can add alt text in brackets and the file in the parenthesis
